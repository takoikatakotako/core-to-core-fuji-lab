        <h2>Project Scheme</h2>

        <img src="images/concept.png" alt="Girl in a jacket">

        <p>&nbsp;The goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular recognition mechanisms of soft molecules that play
            important roles in biomolecules and supramolecules such as DNA and neurotransmission processes from the
            viewpoint of molecular interactions by a Japanese, German, and French molecular cluster research team.
            For example, molecular recognition in neurotransmission is called a "Lock and Key" mechanism, which is
            attributed to the complementarity in shape and charge of the receptor pocket and the neurotransmitter.
            However, both receptors and neurotransmitters are flexible molecules, not rigid like the real lock and key,
            and it is difficult to answer clearly why soft molecules can discriminate between molecules with such small
            differences in molecular structure.
            In this project, we will elucidate the molecular recognition mechanism
            of soft molecules by a joint research team from Japan, Germany, and France, which specializes in gas-phase
            spectroscopy, the most accurate method for studying intermolecular interactions.
            The Japanese, German, and French research teams are complementary in their research methods and targets, and
            the joint research will
            bring us novel ideas and achievements. In addition, each research team includes young researchers and
            graduate students, and by participating in international joint research, they can grow as
            internationally-minded researchers, and further international collaborations will continue to the next
            generation.</p>
